This code is designed for the study of seismic wave propagation in fractured medium (P-SV).
Solving 2-D elastic wave equation in Cartesian Coordinate with Time Domain Finite Difference. 
    this code can use 3 different staggered FD schemes (staggered in space & time):
      (i)   Standard Staggered Grid with 4th-order in space and 2nd-order in time accuracy
      (ii)  2nd-order Rotated Staggered Grid with 2nd-order in space and 2nd-order in time accuracy
      (iii) 4th-order Rotated Staggered Grid with 4th-order in space and 2nd-order in time accuracy
